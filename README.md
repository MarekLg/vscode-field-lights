### Description

*Field Lights* is a dark Visual Studio Theme inspired by the great Ayu (Mirage) theme but adding some personal taste customizations.

The most important differences regarding Ayu Mirage theme are:

- Editor (active tab) "virtually" floating over the window
- Most divisions removed
- Indent guides are a little bit darker
- Cleaner sidebar
- Some other minor customizations


### Usage recommendations

For best results use along with the Ayu *file icon theme*. In the future I've plans to include a custom icon theme with some customizations.
